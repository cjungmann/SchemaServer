.TH schema.fcgi 1 "27 June 2018" "Version 0.75.0005"
.SH NAME
schema.fcgi \- Schema Framework Request Processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBschema.fcgi\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIscript_file.srm\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The primary purpose of \fBschema.fcgi\fR is to respond to HTTP requests with
XML documents generated from results of MySQL procedures.

However, the command also includes several command line options that can be
used to debug various aspects of operation.  For example, an HTTP request can
be simulated with command line options to confirm the output.  An input file,
generated by a special response mode instruction, can be substituted for an
HTTP request for the same purpose.

Other command line options help debug the SRM files.  Special mode viewing
options can show the effective response mode after reconciling the includes
and shares.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Generic Operations"
.TP
.B \-\^\-version
Output the version number and exit.
.SS "Selecting a Mode"
.TP
.B \-s
Name of SRM script file to load.  This is an explicit alternative to including
an option that is not preceded by a dash-option, which will also be interpreted
as an SRM file request.
.TP
.B \-m
Name of the response mode in the SRM script file.
.SS "Executing a Response Mode"
Pass simulated POST parameters to execute the procedure associated with
the response mode to see the XML output.
.TP
.B \-v \fIparameter-name\fR \fIparameter-value\fR
Enter as many parameters as are in the procedure parameter list.
.B \-i \fIinput file name\fR
Use the contents of the input file to submit parameters to the server
program.  The input file can contain an mime-encoded file to simulate
a file import.  See the save-post instruction in the Schema Framework
documentation for help creating an input file.
.SS "Mode Debugging"
When an SRM script file is loaded, the following options will return helpful
information about the script file or the results of imports and shared modes
to the effective response mode.
.TP
.B \-d mode
Print the contents of the named node.
.TP
.B \-d modes
Print a list of the requestable response modes in the SRM file.
.TP
.B \-d all-modes
Prints a list of all modes in the SRM file, including global and shared
modes
.TP
.B \-d types
Prints a list of predefined response mode types. User-defined types are
allowed, but the the server will produce default output. A user-defined
type should expect to be caught in the XSL stylesheet and result in custom
output.
