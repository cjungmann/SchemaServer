   # then the AddHandler associates the action with the file extension

   # AddHandler app/srm .srm


   # The difference between the following and the previous Action/AddHandler
   # is that the Action uses a path to a file, rather than an URL.
   # The question I have is how is URL defined in this situation, in contrast
   # with a file path?
